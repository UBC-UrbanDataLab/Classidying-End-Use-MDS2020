# Proposal 
Create a program that queries live streaming sensor data from the UDL SkySpark database, cleans and uses appropriate ML methods to apply NRCan Secondary End-Use Classifications to the data, and then passes the results to a Grafana visualization dashboard with a few simple example visualizations. 

# Research Question
Based on a buildingâ€™s sensor data, how can the data be grouped automatically into NRCan secondary end use classifications?

# Statement of Work 
In order to develop a viable end-use classification product the following steps were completed:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Feature Selection and Engineering
3. End-Use Classification
4. Pipeline Outputs
5. Visualization
